Turbo Pascal CRT unit-like functions and primitive TUI utilities

## Contents

* `crt.js` - a rough analogue of the Turbo Pascal CRT unit
* `utility.js` - a rough analogue of my own UTILITY.PAS unit from the 1990s which provides simple TUI primitives

## Coming soon

* `cua.js` - building on the above, provides a menu system loosely based on the IBM SAA/CUA guidelines
